	GitHub Usage Guide
	
This is Ensata's basic guide to not ruining other people's contributions to GitHub.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
	
	Always write a summary. 
		Write down the section you reviewed in the commit summary.
		Explain the type of edit performed.
		Definitely explain your edit if you're doing a mass search and replace.
	
	Edit lines in groups. 
		Limit your range as much as possible to avoid potential merge conflicts.
		For example, edit a chunk of 100 lines, from 1-100, or 101-200, etc.

	Do not edit more than ~300 lines in a file in a single commit/pull request. 
		GitHub will not display a diff inside the browser if it exceeds 100kb, which is typically ~300 lines.
	
	Github will not render tsv files as a searchable table if:
		The file is larger than 512kb
		Double quote symbols are not formatted correctly (This is difficult to avoid!)
