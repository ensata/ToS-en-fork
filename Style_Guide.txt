This is Ensata's grammar and style notes for the ToS-en translation.
There is no official one, or else it's not really good enough for precise usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

* Line breaks in dialogue are made by adding the {nl} tag. 
	Add a space before it for readability.
	Don't add a space after, or it will indent the text.
	Maximum line length should be ~100 characters, ie. one average-length sentence.

	
* US English should be used. British English nouns might be used on a limited level for names.


* This game is based on Lithuanian Mythology, which is part of the Baltic myth family. 
	Try to avoid mixing it with Latvian mythology unless there's a good reason.
	Some names will be a direct myth reference. Check the Keywords file.

	
* NPC Names: 
	For world-building and flavour, check for Lithuanian variants of a name and try to use that spelling.
	Latvian names can be a second alternative.
	Polish and Russian names are third.
	
	Do this only if the pronunciation is the same.
	
	
* Writing & Editing
	Avoid non-English alphabet and romanise foreign words. ie. Doppelsöldner -> Doppelsoeldner

	A single-character Unicode ellipsis ( … ) is entered by typing Alt+0133
	
	Do not use Google Translate.

	
* Understanding Korean loanwords
	The Korean text contains loanwords from other languages, including Lithuanian, 
	and forces it into the Korean alphabet. 
	Here is a list of merged consonants in the Korean language.

	L and R can't be distinguished. Most people know this one as a stereotype.
	P and F 
	J and Z
	K and G if it's in the middle of a word
	V and B
	W does not exist, and might appear as OA or OE or something.
	
	You can quickly get the romanisation by punching it into Google Translate.
