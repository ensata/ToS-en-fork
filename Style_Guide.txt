This is Ensata's grammar and style notes for the ToS-en translation.
There is no official one, or else it's not really good enough for precise usage.

------------------

* Line breaks in dialogue are made by adding the {nl} tag. 
	Add a space before it for readability.
	Don't add a space after, or it will indent the text.
	Maximum line length should be ~100 characters, ie. one average-length sentence.

* US English should be used. British English nouns might be used on a limited level for names.

* This game is based on Lithuanian Mythology, which is part of the Baltic myth family. 
	Try to avoid mixing it with Latvian mythology unless there's a good reason.
	Some names will be a direct myth reference. Check the Keywords file.

* NPC Names: 
	For world-building and flavour, check for Lithuanian variants of a name and try to use that spelling.
	Latvian names can be a second alternative.
	Polish and Russian names are third.
	
	Do this only if the pronunciation is the same.
	
* Writing & Editing
	Avoid non-English alphabet and romanise foreign words. ie. Doppelsöldner -> Doppelsoeldner

	A single-character Unicode ellipsis ( … ) is entered by typing Alt+0133
	
	Do not use Google Translate.
	
* GitHub Usage Guide
	Edit lines in groups. For example, edit a chunk of 100 lines, from 1-100, or 101-200, etc.

	Always write a summary. Write down the chunk you reviewed in the commit summary.

	Do not edit more than 300 lines in a file in a single commit/pull request. 
		GitHub will not generate a diff and you will need to use the command line or dig into the commit history to track problems.
		
	Github will not render tsv files as a searchable table if:
	The file is larger than 512kb
	Double quote symbols are not formatted correctly (This can't be avoided!)
